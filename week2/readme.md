ASK BEN : refactor failed - cannot rename across the file automatically

notes:

some string to join the list`.join(`the list to be joined`) : to join elements of a list with something
        e.g name = ["john","nick","bob"]
            print("#".join(name))
            output >> john#nick#bob

string to be formatted`.upper() : make the whole string uppercase
string to be formatted`.lower() : make the whole string lowercase
        e.g print("bruh".upper()) 
        output >> BRUH

map(str,list) : quick way to turn all elements of list into string. output is map type, so need to convert to list again

list[x:y] : elements of list with indices from x to y-1

list.append(something to add to list) : this will add elements to end of list

len(list) : output no. of elements in the list
len(string) : output no. of characters in the string
